How to Use the Tool

The workbook contains three sheets:

"SurveySheet"

This sheet is designed for field use during a pavement distress survey.
It is optional and does not need to be filled for the tool to work.

"Entry"

Enter your field data here.
Use pavement branch codes like RWY, TXY, and APR, followed by the sample unit number (e.g., RWY 01, TXY 02).
These represent Runway, Taxiway, and Apron sections respectively.

"Results"

Simply click on the Run Calculation button.
The tool will automatically calculate PCI values for each pavement branch and also generate the overall PCI.

No installation is required â€” just Excel with macros enabled.
